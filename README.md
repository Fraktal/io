**Io** is an attempt at sentiment analysis using location data from tweets to try and determine patterns of growth and decay of happiness and sadness in the world. The tweets that are being tracked are mined from the twitter streaming API and only the ones tagged with a **:)** and **:(**. By tracking location metadata from tweets, I hope to determine if the emoticon tagged tweets spread like contact network patterns. The initial stages of the project will be to set up the web app to track the location data in real time. 

This is the senior project of **Todd Ervin** at the **University of North Carolina Asheville**. 


**REMINDER:** This app is under construction and exists in a constant state of development

Many thanks to amithn/tweet-plotter. I learned the proper way to implement a real time web app for twitter.
